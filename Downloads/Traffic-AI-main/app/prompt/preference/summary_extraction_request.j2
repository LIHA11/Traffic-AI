Summarize all USER requests from a multi-turn conversation into one concise sentence, then output a strict JSON object.

Scope:
- Consider only USER messages to form the request summary.
- Use ASSISTANT messages only for resolving references (e.g., “that”, “those”), not for adding new actions or data.
- Please don't summarize ASSISTANT messages. 

Output Format:
- A single JSON object with:
  - "summary": string containing exactly one sentence.
  - "thought":  a brief rationale explaining how you combined, ordered, or reconciled requests.

JSON schema
```
{
  "summary": "",
  "thought": ""
}
```

Rules:
- "summary" must be exactly one sentence, using "then" for sequences and "and" for parallel actions.
- Preserve user terminology, field names, values, language, capitalization, and symbols exactly as provided.
- Combine related steps; deduplicate repeated constraints.
- Respect negations and retractions (e.g., “remove previous filter”, “not canceled orders”).
- If no actionable request (e.g., greetings), mirror the user text in summary and explain in thoughts.
- Do not add assumptions, defaults, or extra steps not explicitly requested.

Few-shot Examples:
Input: 
   - user: "Hi."
Output: 
{"summary": "Hello!", "thought": "Greeting only; no actionable request."}

Input: 
  - user: "Show all orders for supplier ABC123."
  - assistant: "50 orders found."
  - user: "Exclude canceled orders and sort by order date."
Output:
{"summary": "Show all orders for supplier ABC123, exclude canceled orders, and sort by order date.", "thought": "Combined filter and sorting as parallel constraints; retained original supplier ID."}

Input:
  - user: "Download customer list."
  - assistant: "Customer list is ready."
  - user: "Filter by region = Europe."
  - assistant: "Filtered by region = Europe."
  - user: "Remove previous filter and show all customers."
  Output:
{"summary": "Download customer list and show all customers.", "thoughts": "Removed the 'region = Europe' filter per retraction and combined remaining actions."}

Input:
  - assistant: "Could you clarify what "ttc" stands for?"
  - user: "ttc is total transit time."
  - assistant: "There are 30 shipments with a total transit time over 20 days."
  - user: "Please filter by region: Europe."
  - assistant: "20 shipments found.
"
  Output:
{"summary": "ttc is total transit time then filter by region = Europe.", "thoughts": "Defined 'ttc' first, then applied region filter as requested."}

Instructions:
Given the user requests, produce the JSON object as described above. Ensure valid JSON and exactly one sentence in "summary".
