**Convert the provided plan into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and output as JSON.**

**Output format:**
```json
{
  "dag": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "task_description": "<verbatim details of the subtask from the plan>",
        "success_criteria": "<verbatim success criteria from the plan>"
      }
      // ... more nodes
    ],
    "edges": [
      [
        {"soruce": "<node index>"},
        {"target": "<node index>"}
      ]
      // ... more edges
    ]
  }
}
```

**Instructions:**
1. For each main step in the plan, create a node in `"nodes"`:
   - Each node in `"nodes"` must include:
    - `"description"`: All details about the subtask, copied exactly from the plan (do not paraphrase, summarize, or remove information).
    - `"success_criteria"`: All original success criteria for the subtask, copied verbatim.
2. In `"edges"`, represent dependencies between nodes as ordered pairs, showing which steps must precede others.
3. The graph must be a single, connected, directed acyclic graph (DAG).
4. Do **not** include repeated or optional steps in the DAG.
5. Do **not** add, omit, or modify any information from the plan in the `"description"` or `"success_criteria"` 
6. If you don't see the dependency task in the plan, it means it has been completed.
7. No cycle in the edges is allowed, meaning no node can depend on itself or create a loop. (If there are only one node, no edges should be present.)
8. Output the JSON in single line without any formatting or indentation.

**Given plan:**  
{{plan}}
